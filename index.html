    <h3> Culture of India</h3>
<p>
    Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.
    [378] During the Vedic period (c. 1700 BCE – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy, mythology,
    theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma,
    kárma, yóga, and mokṣa, were established.[75] India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism,
    Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the nation's major religions.[379] The predominant religion,
    Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,[380] the Yoga Sutras, 
    the Bhakti movement,[379] and by Buddhist philosophy.[381]
